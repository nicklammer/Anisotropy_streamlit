# Anisotropy Fitting with Streamlit

The gist: I have a repo with scripts to fit fluorescence anisotropy data from binding assays. I do not like the UI I built so I'm reworking the scripts to work with Streamlit instead. A lab could host this locally and anyone can access it without having to install on their own machine.
